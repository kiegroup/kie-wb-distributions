- TODOS
    - Remove artifact versions from module pom's
        - IP BOM
            - Review the dependency list -> not all should be added... (e.g. com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:jar)
            - https://github.com/jboss-integration/jboss-integration-platform-bom
            - Do not add all third party library versions there
            - If an artifact version is present, but not the desired one, override it in the kie-parent-with-dependencies.
            - Split the pull requests in several ones...
    - Modules integration with other frameworks
        - Should use a common modules repository? Several frameworks have same modules..
        - All third party jars should be in a single module?
            - for example, we can use xmlpull:xmlpull:jar and xpp3:xpp3_min:jar in same static module.

            - He knows a lot about modules
            - Ask who can help me

        - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1039716 -> Modules refactor (maven plugin)
        - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1037733 (EAP modules built too late)
    - Dynamic module inter-dependencies - Dashbuilder must depend on kie-wb
    - Review dependencies
        - Why the static dependencies applied? Are pom references to these artifacts missing?
        - Duplicated module? org.osgi:6.1.0-SNAPSHOT (STATIC) / org.osgi.core:main (EAP)
    - Slot for modules of 3rd party jars should use it's own version, not the project one. (David Ward)

- Other TODOS
    - Dependency builder issues
        - Base modules: The current impl considers that all base dependencies are not exported, but some of them are exported (export=true)
        - If a static module definition contains an exported (forced export=true) dependency, flat dependency builder impl must detect it and do not re-export it in parent dependant modules.
    - Maven 3.1.X support
    - Change module dependencies from optional=true to scope=provided in static modules definitions??
    - README.md's
    - Plugin -> Deploy goal
    - Report generation -> mvn site.
